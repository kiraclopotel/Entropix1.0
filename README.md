1. Introduction Overview This document presents a comprehensive approach to cryptographic key generation and encryption using adaptive layered functions, dynamic coefficient shifts, controlled noise injection, and advanced algebraic structures. The
proposed system introduces flexibility and adaptability, leveraging non-linearity and randomness to enhance security and resist cryptanalytic attacks.

Motivation Traditional cryptographic systems often rely on fixed mathematical structures, making them potentially vulnerable to specific types of attacks due to predictable patterns. The need for dynamic and adaptable cryptographic techniques is growing
as threat landscapes evolve. This system aims to address these challenges by introducing innovative mathematical foundations and algorithms that enhance unpredictability and security.

2.2. Dynamic Coefficient Shifts Concept Coefficients 𝑐 𝑘 c k ​ and 𝑏 𝑘 b k ​ are dynamically adjusted at each iteration to introduce additional randomness and prevent predictability.
